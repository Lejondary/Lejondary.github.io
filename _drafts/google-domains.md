# All Your Domain Are Belong To Me.  

I've purchased my own domain through Google Domains.  
lejondary.dev is the name.  
Is are belong to me now and forever.  

I had been planning on purchasing it for quite some time now.
But I wanted to wait for a good time to.  
Which is now, I guess, since I passed my PCA exam.  
As to what exactly I'm going to do to with it remains to be seen.  
Experiment I shall and see where it takes me.  
But for sure, I want to live up to the name I've chosen for it at least.  

To be a lejondary.dev!
