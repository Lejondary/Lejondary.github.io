# I PASSED AGAIN!

I PASSED MY GCP PROFESSIONAL CLOUD ARCHITECT CERT!  
Officially on 12/20/22. LETS GOOOOO!   
Just before the end of the year, I accomplished one of my goals.   
I could've and should've taken it sooner because honestly...  
I felt like the exam wasn't as difficult as I thought it was going to be.   
There were people who believed that I should've done it sooner and they were right, but my self-doubt took the better of me.   
ITS OKAY THO.   
I went at my pace.   
I'm learning more and more about myself. It wasn't all in vain.   
It just means that I need to have more confidence in my skills and abilities.  
Mindset change for the better.   

NEXT STEP: THE NEXT CERT!  
WHICH ONE THO?  
I haven't decided yet.   
Although, I'm leaning towards Data Engineer or Cloud Security Engineer or Cloud Database Engineer.  
Eventually, all of them.   
LETS GET IT!
