# INSPIRATION

It's been a while since I've messed around with my lejondary site.  
I want to change that.  
I plan to nurture and love this site for myself again.  
Neon Genesis Evangelion, one of my favorites animes, gave me the inspiration again. And this <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/28760/neon-genesis-evangelion" target="_blank">link</a>.  
It's an article that explores the types of fonts used in NGE title cards, one of NGE's most unique and recognizable traits.  
I thought to myself, "How could I apply this awesome font to my site?"  
Honestly sounds low key fun.  
Then I realized I've been neglecting my lejondary site like Shinji is by Gendo.  
RIP.  
NO MORE.  
To be more accountable to myself.  
This is my idea:  
I'm going to make my journal entry post layout look like NGE title cards.

Something along the lines of:  

<img src="/assets/img/eva_title_inspo.png" alt="eva title inspo"/>

I don't know about you, but it looks super duper cool to me.  
Hopefully its possible to turn this idea into coded reality.  

One more thing:  
I want to try to make my journal entries a historical record of my accomplishments and the process of those accomplishments.  
It would be interesting to be able to look back on my thinking process in real time. With that said...  

Not only was I inspired by NGE font, I accomplished setting up SSHing into GitHub for WSL today.    
Wasn't too difficult, but I want to use WSL more for the projects I have planned.  
Because Linux is way better and cooler tbh.  
I created some repos for some project ideas I have in mind, too.  

Sometimes I think I can be a too ambitious with project ideas.  
But is it bad to be too ambitious?  
To some extent, I suppose.  
Either way, talking about this low key is getting me excited for the future!  

Lastly, I want to say that I'm thankful and grateful for the people in my life.  
The life I've lived so far.
