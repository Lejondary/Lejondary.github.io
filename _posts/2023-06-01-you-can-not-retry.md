# YOU CAN (NOT) RETRY

So I didn't do what I said I was going to do.  
Unfortunately.  
But I'm going to retry.  
I'm going to retry not gendo ikari'ing this guy.  
And I've come back with more ideas, plans, and most importantly.  
Persistence.  
Life is all about it really.  
It's honestly gotten me pretty excited.  
Due to the fact that I've come to some realizations about myself.  
Welp.  
Time to get to it!
