# I PASSED!

For my first post ever, I'm proud to say I DID IT! I PASSED MY GCP ASSOCIATE CLOUD ENGINEER CERT! Officially on 08/12/22. I was doubtful of myself and capabilities, but this certification invalidated those feelings.
I'm truly grateful for the people who encouraged and believed in me when I didn't.  
Thank you guys so much.  

Angelica, for being there for me, always no matter what.    
Lynn, thank you especially, for being a great mentor, for being my first and best body double ever, and an overall wonderful person.  
I don't think I could've done it without your guidance, honestly.   

You guys are the best people I've ever known and have changed my life for the better.
I love you guys.  

This is just the first step in my lejondary journey to become a master pro. Cheesy, but I like cheese.  

Next cert, GCP Professional Cloud Architect!
