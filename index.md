# About Me

I am a cloud craftsman with a computer, curious about all things technology-related.

Innovation and experimentation excites me more than alliteration attempts to, enticing me to focus on the next big interesting idea. Coding is a sea of constant learning, which calls to all my passions; it satisfies my cravings for creativity and problem solving, enables me to develop innovative software solutions, and create robust and scalable applications.

I love applying cloud-native architecture principles; designing a system that is reliable, resilient, elastic, and independent; and watching everything working together autonomously exactly how I envisioned it. It's ridiculously rewarding. I believe in a way I'm sort of like cloud-native applications; I'm adaptable in an environment where the only constant is change.

Collaboration is at the core of my approach. I thrive within collaborative environments, cherishing constructive feedback and open dialogue as essential elements to engineering effective cloud solutions.

When my head isn't in the clouds, I'm either lifting weights in the gym, working on my golf swing, or playing the piano!

Let's connect, learn something new from each other, and explore potential collaborations!
