# About Me

I am a cloud craftsman with a computer, curious about all things technology-related.

Innovation and experimentation excite me more than alliteration could ever attempt to, enticing me to obssess on the next big interesting idea that catches my fancy. A friend once said that "coding is a sea of constant learning," which calls to all my passions; it satisfies my cravings for creativity and problem solving, enables me to develop innovative software solutions, and create robust and scalable applications.

I love applying cloud-native architecture principles; designing a system that is reliable, resilient, elastic, and independent; and watching everything working together autonomously exactly how I envisioned it. It's ridiculously rewarding. I believe in a way I'm sort of like cloud-native applications; I'm adaptable in an environment where the only constant is change.

Currently, I've eagerly started exploring and experimenting with emerging technologies in data analysis, machine learning, and generative ai to further my understanding in this field.

When my head isn't in the technologic clouds, I'm either playing the piano, strategizing fantasy football drafts, or trailblazing in honkai star rail!
